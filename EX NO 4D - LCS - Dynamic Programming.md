# EX 4D Longest Common SubSequence - Dynamic Programming.
## DATE: 19/10/2025
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Constraints:

1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Algorithm
✅ **Procedure:**

1. **Input:**

   * Read two strings, `text1` and `text2`, from the user.

2. **Initialization:**

   * Let `m` = length of `text1` and `n` = length of `text2`.
   * Create a 2D array `dp[m+1][n+1]`, where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`.

3. **Filling the DP Table:**

   * For each `i` from `1` to `m`:

     * For each `j` from `1` to `n`:

       * If characters match (`text1.charAt(i-1) == text2.charAt(j-1)`):
         → `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`
       * Else:
         → `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`

4. **Result:**

   * The value `dp[m][n]` gives the **length of the longest common subsequence**.

5. **Output:**

   * Print the result:
     `"Length of Longest Common Subsequence: " + dp[m][n]`
